Jerry retired in October of 2021.However, Carl never realized that Jerry?s accounts were set up with no advisor fee.  They were only being charged the platform and manager fees.

The cause of the restriction was due to 3 liquidation strikes in a rolling 12 month period.  A liquidation strike occurs when the account buys more than it sold or has cash for, then sells the next day (or later) to cover the over purchase.  The result is that the account is restriction for 90 days to cash on hand trades.XHC001432 - (903L) Ninety Day Restriction - 3 Liquidations Funds on hand restriction till 01/31/2022(LQT1) Liquidation 02/26/2021 vs Buy of 02/25/2021(LQT2) Liquidation 08/31/2021 vs Buy of 08/30/2021(LQT3) Liquidation 10/28/2021 vs Buy of 10/27/2021 I?m wondering if you can help us bring this example to the manager (CNR) and help us figure out how they can avoid these strikes going forward.',\n",

As this is a Voya account, we see in the very begging a large spike in net investment and drop in market value. Per the footnote, it is representing total value of contributions and withdrawals, but the advisor is alleging that no contributions or withdrawals of that magnitude took place prior to Jan 2014. This account?s actual history goes back to 1993, and overtime there have been changes in ownership between what were folio accounts and as I understand those were acquired by Envestnet around 2014 when this account was still over at voya. What we would like to know is who owns this performance data back to the beginning of the account, we think its Envestnet. We would also like to verify that this spike is likely caused by the change or conversion between prior folio accounts and Envestnet around the time prior to Jan 2014 where we see the spike. And if this is accurate, why the spike when there were no inflows or outflows? Best Regards,Frank',\n",

The risk rating for the model is listed at Moderate but is currently showing in these accounts at Aggressive Growth.Per HO:this manager has only aggressive equity positions in a model that has a risk rating of moderate, with two dummy positions in their model.

The Advisor who was contacted by them has 24 clients in this standalone sleeve/model.
