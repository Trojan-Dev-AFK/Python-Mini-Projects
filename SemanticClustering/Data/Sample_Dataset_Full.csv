The result is that the account is restriction for 90 days to cash on hand trades.XHC001432 - (903L) Ninety Day Restriction - 3 Liquidations Funds on hand restriction till 01/31/2022(LQT1) Liquidation 02/26/2021 vs Buy of 02/25/2021(LQT2) Liquidation 08/31/2021 vs Buy of 08/30/2021(LQT3) Liquidation 10/28/2021 vs Buy of 10/27/2021 I?m wondering if you can help us bring this example to the manager (CNR) and help us figure out how they can avoid these strikes going forward."

" There is a billing issue for some of our advisor?s MAA accounts.  Our advisor, Carl Johns, purchased the book of business of another former advisor, Gerald Spaniol.  As part of their agreement, Carl was going to take over as advisor of record on Jerry?s personal accounts once he retired.  Jerry retired in October of 2021.However, Carl never realized that Jerry?s accounts were set up with no advisor fee.  They were only being charged the platform and manager fees.  I?ve instructed Carl on how to change the fees moving forward by using the Goal Modification tool.  However, he would like to know if we are able to get the advisor fees turned on starting January 1, 2022.  Is there a way for us to do this?  I think Jerry would be more than willing to sign whatever documents that we require.The accounts in question are:?	RT8001008?	RT8001016?	RT8001024?	RT8001032?	RT8001040?	RT8001017?

" ICS, On page 4 of the QPR, bottom right corner, graph of market value vs net investment, I am understanding it is showing the aggregate of the household performance. As this is a Voya account, we see in the very begging a large spike in net investment and drop in market value. Per the footnote, it is representing total value of contributions and withdrawals, but the advisor is alleging that no contributions or withdrawals of that magnitude took place prior to Jan 2014. This account?s actual history goes back to 1993, and overtime there have been changes in ownership between what were folio accounts and as I understand those were acquired by Envestnet around 2014 when this account was still over at voya. What we would like to know is who owns this performance data back to the beginning of the account, we think its Envestnet. We would also like to verify that this spike is likely caused by the change or conversion between prior folio accounts and Envestnet around the time prior to Jan 2014 where we see the spike. And if this is accurate, why the spike when there were no inflows or outflows? Best Regards,Frank"

EX: ACM-MRMDO, what updates this product score?Morningstar data? It doesn?t come from the strategist, does it?a) If the information comes from Morningstar then how does Morningstar know the strategist changed their composition?2. Is portfolio risk (assessed risk) calculated based purely on the holdings? It wouldn?t come from a strategy assigned risk classification or configuration, right?

The risk rating for the model is listed at Moderate but is currently showing in these accounts at Aggressive Growth.Per HO:this manager has only aggressive equity positions in a model that has a risk rating of moderate, with two dummy positions in their model. It?s a pretty obvious error on the part of the manager, and it is causing risk variances which are being reviewed by our Compliance and Sales Supervision teams. The Advisor who was contacted by them has 24 clients in this standalone sleeve/model. According to the rep, who spoke with the portfolio manager for this product, the moderate allocation for their managed product is based on the entire lifespan of the managed product. It?s still unsuitable for a moderate allocation managed product to hold aggressive investments as the client has only agreed on the SIS for a moderate risk investment.- can you please review with the manager and advise?"

" ICS, Please delete advisor Donald Kemp's advisor program sleeve ""AS-805"" from the platform. We receive an alert message that the system cannot delete the AS-805 because it is in use for the build-in-models: ""Model - Mileson Beneficiary IRA"" and ""Model - Mike Griffin IRA"" This is confirmed to be untrue via visual inspection of an alphabetically sorted book of business report of all of Donald Kemp's accounts. These products are not in use, and are not in use in any active proposals either. I also confirmed that they are not in use for any accounts under the specified client name. I also cannot find it under a dashboard report as a model that is in use.

"- We received an inquiry from manager Meeder on this account regarding some trade information that is flowing back to APL  and our platform from the custodian which seems incorrect on the custodian's end.Just as an example, ticker AAPL was sold on 2/28, 14 units with an execution price of $148.15. The principal here should be 2074.1. However, data from the custodian is sending back a principal of $2072.60. This is happening throughout the entire account. The price x shares are not equaling the principal flowing back. We do not see any hidden fees or things alike. Would you be able to view on your end and confirm if the custodian is sending back accurate information?"

" ICS, i believe there to be a MMMF coding problem with this account similar to the fund TISXX which was incorrectly coded in another account for advisor Zach Davis which resulted in a trade error. The reference account is RT608274. The recommended course of action is to change the core MMMF to IDSA. However will likely result in ""selling to cover"" a debit when we should be doing corrections. Based on the other, similar issue we would expect Envestnet to cover these correction costs.I will send a follow up email to ICSsupport@envestnet.com, also please note that Cetera has filed an extension on this account today (4/5) which is reportable and now due 4/12 by 2PM ET.

"- ICS,For this client, when a performance report for Choice Client (No market analysis) is run on the ""rollup of accounts"" selection, the net investment on page 3 reflects the aggregate of all 4 accounts under this profile, meaning it is including the accounts that are closed. And specifically, account #  ?REUSE - FLF000118? has a negative net investment number and so the ""net investment"" in the performance report is not as expected. By extension, the performance is askew as well. When we look at page 4 we see a large dip in the AUG-SEP timeframe when the accounts were repapered, and we would like to run a report that includes accounts performance back to inception without this discrepancy.Is there an option or set of options we can select to show account performance back to inception that excludes the negative net investment for account FLF000118? If so, please let us know how to do this, if not, how can we explain the dip on page 4 when the accounts were repapered between AUG-SEP?I attached the performance report we are looking at for your convenience."

"Performance - Please see the below form Cetera and advise. In account HF7073645 there were unsupervised C Shares, that converted to an advisory share class in Oct. 2017. Since the C shares were not included in performance since they were unsupervised, the expectation would be that when it converted to supervised advisory share class this would be treated as a contribution/new investment, however it appears that they are being treated as capital appreciation.  This is throwing off the performance calculations in the account.  Is this working how expected?If so, does this only apply to when C shares convert to advisory share classes or does this apply to all unsupervised positions that move to supervised?"

" could you please take a look at the report I included in this SR for account 3271-4612?The advisor was concerned about the report that does not look right, as the returns are over 100% for most QTD and YTD funds compared to the benchmark. The rep said that they had a large distribution in January for a remodel and are taking $3,000 per month for living expenses.  Maybe the large distribution impacted this calculation somehow?It was however very odd though, I checked the report today and the numbers are drastically different, and look more accurate. Not sure why the report from 5/1 would have had those numbers. I attached both for reference. Thank you."

(Image #2) Cetera believes the performance that should be shown should be consistent with the marketing rule?s requirement to show minimum 1, 5, 10 (or since inception if shorter than any of those periods). I suspectthat the disclosure is consistent/static across all online reports and the snapshot report timeframe is ""fixed"", therefore the snapshot report wouldnt include additional/different time periods.If you could advise when you have a free moment on these items i would greatly appreciate it - please let me know if you have any questions as well as if you would prefer i submit this inquiry via jira/gsr - thank you kindly!!"
